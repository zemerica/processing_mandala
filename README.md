## processing_mandala
This is a fun visualization originally written in Processing for Python.  It creates an animated mandala with some interesting periodicity / resonance characteristics.

A version adapted for the web using p5.js is also included in this repository.

This project is described at on my blog, <a href="http://erica.wythasea.net/kinetic-mandala/">Datadelia</a>
